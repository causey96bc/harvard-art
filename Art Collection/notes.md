All requests to the API begin with:

https://api.harvardartmuseums.org

And all requests must also specify the resource you want to retrieve:

https://api.harvardartmuseums.org/RESOURCE_TYPE

And every request must be accompanied by the apikey parameter and an API key. The API uses keys to authenticate requests. API keys take the form 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000. Here is the full structure of a typical request:
